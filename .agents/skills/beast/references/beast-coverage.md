# Octane coverage map

This map compares Beast with Octane's official [Quick start], [Core APIs],
[TSRX vs TSX/JSX], [Differences from React], and [Build tools] documentation.
It tracks three different concerns separately:

- **Authoring syntax**: whether BTSX can express the documented TSRX shape.
- **Runtime passthrough**: whether normal imports, setup statements,
  attributes, and component tags can use an Octane API without Beast-specific
  syntax.
- **Integration coverage**: whether the repository proves the behavior in a
  complete build or server lifecycle.

Beast does not need a special grammar feature for every Octane API. Most hooks
and components are TypeScript calls or component references, and should pass
through `import`, `setup`, attributes, and nesting unchanged.

## Covered today

| Octane area | Beast coverage | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Components, typed props, children | Native elements, component references, source imports, typed props, and tagless local component declarations | `app`, `provider` goldens |
| Setup and hooks | Inline TypeScript setup; `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useEffect` compile through Octane | `counter` golden |
| Advanced hooks | Initialized reducer/current-state getter, insertion/layout phases, effect events, generated IDs, imperative handles, stable callbacks, memoized components, and debug labels | `hooks` golden, client lowering assertions, and SSR assertion |
| Module/setup source | Inline and multiline raw TypeScript, module directives, comments, blank lines, refs, and effect cleanup | `shortcut` golden |
| Refs | Object refs, callback refs with cleanup, and arrays of refs pass through as ordinary props | `refs`, `shortcut` goldens |
| Native events and attributes | Expression, string, boolean, spread, ARIA, data, class, ID, native `onInput`, and form events, with authored spread precedence | `catalog`, `counter`, `editor`, `styling` goldens |
| Element composition and CSS | Explicit and automatic fragments plus raw, component-scoped style blocks with `:global()` escapes | `fragment`, `styling` goldens and styling SSR assertion |
| Linked controlled state | Strong-mode `useLinkedState` reconciles editable state by source identity | `editor` golden |
| External stores | Stable subscription/client snapshot functions and a deterministic server snapshot pass through `useSyncExternalStore` | `network` golden and SSR assertion |
| Responsive updates | `useTransition` marks tab changes as non-urgent while `useDeferredValue` lets search results lag behind controlled input | `responsive` golden and SSR assertion |
| View transitions | `ViewTransition` receives named enter/exit/update classes while `addTransitionType` selects a directional class map inside `startTransition` | `transitions` golden, client preload assertion, and SSR annotation assertion |
| Portals | A module helper passes a tagless local component and its props through `createPortal` while preserving logical event ancestry | `portal` golden, SSR placeholder assertion, and executable cross-container lifecycle |
| Actions and forms | `useActionState` owns submission state, `useFormStatus` reads it below the form, `useOptimistic` stages a row, and `requestFormReset` resets after success | `actions` golden and SSR assertion |
| Conditions | `if`, `elseif`, and `else` emit native `@if` arms | `card`, `status` goldens |
| Keyed lists | Item/index bindings, explicit keys, and single-root key hoisting emit `@for` | `card`, `catalog`, `status` goldens |
| Empty lists | An aligned `empty` branch emits native `@empty` | `catalog` golden |
| Multi-way branches | `switch`, `case`, and `default` emit native `@switch` arms | `variant` golden |
| Async/error boundaries | `try`, `pending`, and bound `catch` emit native boundary arms | `boundary` golden |
| Runtime boundary components | `lazy` composes under `Suspense` and `ErrorBoundary`; Promise reads prove fulfilled, pending, and rejected server paths; `Activity` covers visible/hidden/prerender output | `deferred`, `async` goldens and async SSR assertions |
| Deferred hydration | Every activation strategy, dynamic selection, strategy/procedural prefetch, fallback/completion props, default child extraction, permanent-static ranges, server markers, and idempotent early event capture | `hydration` golden, extracted-child compile, SSR assertions, and capture test |
| Library and resources | Element creation/cloning, descriptor and children-block checks, all five `Children` methods, six resource/connection APIs, transition pseudo-element handles, and package version | `library` golden and SSR assertions plus pseudo-element/version runtime test |
| Fragments and text holes | Explicit and automatic output fragments, text-only lines, escaping, and interpolation | `fragment`, `styling` goldens |
| Context | Module-scoped `createContext`, dotted `Theme.Provider`, and local `use()`/`useContext()` consumers | `provider` golden |
| Client ownership | Root mount/update/unmount, server-DOM adoption, dormant-boundary activation and event replay, synchronous/test scheduling, cross-container portals, and non-reconciling behavior ownership | Executable Happy DOM lifecycle suite |
| Server and static rendering | Hydratable/static buffered output, scoped CSS/head channels, Node and Web progressive streams, await-everything output, aborts, deadlines, and complete Node preludes | Executable renderer lifecycle suite |
| Public entry points | Every tracked name is present in the pinned `octane`, hydration, behavior, server, and static module namespaces | Machine-readable Core API inventory test |
| Vite application lifecycle | Mixed BTSX/TSRX production build plus a BTSX SSR render, server-DOM adoption, interaction replay, and compiler-split deferred chunk | Executable project integration tests |
| Rspack application lifecycle | Mixed BTSX/TSRX client build with a compiler-split deferred chunk plus an executable Node-target SSR render | Executable bundler integration test |
| Rsbuild application lifecycle | Mixed compiler-only build plus routed browser and Node environments whose generated handler SSR-renders a BTSX route | Executable bundler integration tests |
| Source-map pipeline | Declaration, multiline source-body, template-node, branch, and attribute anchors compose through Octane to original BTSX in Vite and Rspack output | Compiler mapping assertions plus emitted Vite and Rspack map tests |
| Standalone watch lifecycle | Debounced and serialized project rebuilds, ignored output events, stale cleanup, compile-error reporting, and recovery after a valid edit | Executable project API and CLI watcher tests |

Every golden output is compared byte for byte and compiled with the pinned
Octane compiler. The focused lifecycle suites execute the non-template entry
points, while a machine-readable inventory guards every tracked public export.

## Public Core API ledger

This ledger is the completion contract for Beast's Core API conformance work.
It follows Octane's official [Core APIs] index, the hydration strategies taught
on that page, and the public rendering functions from `octane/server` and
`octane/static` in the pinned `octane@0.1.37` types. Compiler-emitted runtime
helpers, metaframework RPC internals, compatibility aliases, and type-only
exports are outside this user-facing scope.

Every public Core API row is now `Covered`. This means its committed example or
lifecycle test is documented and passes the repository's release checks; it
does not claim coverage for compiler-private helpers or metaframework internals.
The inventory test also fails if any tracked name disappears from its pinned
public entry point.

## Next additions

### 1. Add framework-specific adapters

Vite, Rspack, and Rsbuild now cover the core bundler contracts. Add
framework-specific adapters only where their routing or server ownership needs
more than the normal Rsbuild application plugin.

## Recommended order

The remaining work is framework-specific: add adapters as concrete routing or
server-ownership requirements emerge beyond the normal Rsbuild application
plugin.
