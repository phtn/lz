# Beast with Vite

Read this reference only for Vite integration.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import { beastOctane } from "beast-tsrx/vite"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    beastOctane({
      octane: { strong: true },
    }),
  ],
})
```

Import `.btsx` and native `.tsrx` normally. Beast generates TSRX in memory before Octane. The complete adapter forwards HMR, selects server lowering during SSR transforms, and routes compiler-split `Hydrate` child queries through the originating `.btsx` module.

Do not install both `beastOctane()` and a second Octane compiler plugin for the same module graph. Use the Beast-only `beast()` adapter only when the matching Octane integration is already configured.

For Tailwind, place `tailwindcss()` before `beastOctane()` and import Tailwind from the generated stylesheet:

```ts
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite"

plugins: [tailwindcss(), beastOctane()]
```

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

Run the project's TSRX-aware typecheck and production Vite build after configuration changes. Vite composes the BTSX→TSRX map through Octane so downstream JavaScript locations can trace to authored BTSX.
